    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="about-text">From late night Roblox Gaming when I was a kid to tapping heads in games now. 
        I've always been an avid gamer ever since I was a kid. 
        From long nights grinding levels to building out the perfect setup, gaming is what first pulled me into the world of tech. 
        That passion stuck with me, and eventually it led to building custom PCs. 
        I've been building PCs for almost a decade now. 
        I don't build just to sell, every system I make is something I'd proudly use myself. 
        I care about both performance and how the PC looks, 
        and I take the time to make sure each one runs smoothly 
        and feels high quality. 
        This isn't about making a quick buck. 
        It's why I spend more on aesthetic parts that can make it hard to sell, 
        but it's worth it to me. 
        This is about building great machines that reflect the kind of care and detail 
        I'd want in my own setup.
